# Web-scraping-Wallapop
Assignment 3 of the MIBA 22/23 course Cloud Computing in Term 1.

The Jupyter Notebook found in this repository web scrapes "Wallapop" (a somewhat Spanish version of eBay) for bicycles of different categories as well as usage conditions. The retrieved results are then stored in a dataframe and also used for some preliminary data analysis. Namely, we check the average bicycle price for each condition and usage state.
