# Web-scraping-Wallapop
Assignment 3 of the MIBA 22/23 course Cloud Computing in Term 1.

The jupyter notebook found in this repository web scrapes "Wallapop" (a somewhat spanish version of ebay) for bycicles of different categories as well as usage conditions. The retrieved results are then stores in a dataframe and also used for some preliminary data analysis. Namely, we check the average bycicle price for each condition and usage state.
